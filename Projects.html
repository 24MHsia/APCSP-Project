    <p class = "p">One of my largest academic projects was my I-search, an essay that I made in 9th Grade English. The projects entails a media search, an interview with a professional, a graphic, and a your own proposal for involvement. My I-Search was about carbon capture technology, and it was very meaningful because environmental conservation is important to me.</p>

    <p class = "p">Another academic project is my create preformance task, made in APCSP class. In the project, I submitted some code and a video of the code functioning. I had to explain the purpose and functionality, an example of lists being used to manage complexity, an example of a procedure that implements an algorithm and a call to the procedure, and describe two calls to the procedure. In my project, I created a calculator for various basic statistical functions. The project really showed all the programming knowledge that I had learned over the schoolyear, and creating the project I was able to learn more about programming.</p>
